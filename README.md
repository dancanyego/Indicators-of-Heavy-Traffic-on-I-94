In this project, we tried to find a few indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. We managed to find two types of indicators: 

**Time indicators**
- The traffic is usually heavier during warm months (March–October) compared to cold months (November–February).
- The traffic is usually heavier on business days compared to the weekends.
- On business days, the rush hours are around 7 and 16.


**Weather indicators**
- Shower snow
- Light rain and snow
- Proximity thunderstorm with drizzle
